<!-- Take home message: convince people before the meeting has started -->

You're on a minesite in the middle of nowhere in outback Western Australia, talking to staff of the company responsible 
for digging up gold. They have recently signed up to your software product. This product collects data off of mining equipment
like trucks and excavators, analyses it in the cloud, and provides reports highlighting areas where operation could be safer 
or more efficient. More efficient operation means fewer greenhouse gas emissions for the earth, and a lower fuel bill for them.
Win-win.

But there's a catch. You're not the first software product these people have used. They've repeatedly been victims of inaccurate
data, incorrect analysis, or missing context. Many have become calous, with a deep mistrust for automation. 
Especially coming from you, a software engineer from the "city", wearing a shiny new high visibility jacket who clearly has no 
background in mining.

Luckily, you are not alone. Your company partnered with a site coach consultancy, experienced in teaching mine site operators
how to operate more effectively. He is very familiar with the push-back you're going to receive, even in the face of overwhelming
numerical evidence. You have 1 week on this minesite, and on the last day there is a meeting with every decision maker on the site.
For our visit to be a success, everyone in that meeting needs to be convinced of your products value, and starting to use it 
every day. 

Your first two days are focussed on absorbing as much context as possible. What information people need, and when. What they care about 
and what they don't. Identifying and excluding red herrings and non-starters. 
Then you work really begins, you then have enough data and context to start processing

His advice? Walk the data around.
