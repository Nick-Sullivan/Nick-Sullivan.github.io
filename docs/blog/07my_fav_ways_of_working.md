<!-- Take home message: practical recommendation for tech company process -->

Every company has a unique way of going from ideation to production. I'd like to share with you my favourite approach.

### Ideate

Good ideas can come from anyone. It's important to treat every suggestion with appropriate consideration. Granted, most will be rejected because of practicality, timing, expense, or alignment with long-term goals; but there will still be lots of actionable suggestions. Occasionally, someone will think up something that can create enormous product value or fundamentally shift the way the business thinks.

I prefer an organic approach here, where people initially discuss ideas with those they are most comfortable with. If it gets a positive reaction, they should discuss it upwards in 1-1s or a skip level. It's important for leaders to make it clear that they are receptive to new ideas.

### Categorise

All ideas that we wish to action get categorised into one of three buckets:
- Projects

  Spanning from a week to a few months, projects are scoped, planned, and prioritised by the business. They have high visibility in the company and have upfront solution designs. Teams take time to celebrate when a project is completed.

- Bite-sized work

  Usually less than a week. The overhead associated with regular prioritisation and estimation can quickly outweigh the time spent implementing it, so they are treated first-come-first-served in a Kanban style.

- Bugs

  The way a company handles bugs is a yardstick for its culture. If tech teams are given sufficient time to create a quality product (and have the expertise to do so), then bugs should be minimal, making it feasible to fix all bugs quickly. But if this is not the case, bugs should be treated similarly to bite-sized work. Even "unimportant" bugs should be fixed or masked from error reporting so they do not conceal "important" bugs or create a culture of bugs being acceptable.

### Implement

When a team starts a project, all team members focus solely on that project. It minimises context switching, time spent on progress reports, and the number of stakeholders. I know that it often feels more productive to be working on multiple bodies of work, but it is an illusion of productivity that I would recommend avoiding.

Once a project is complete, the team celebrates, then shifts over to pulling in bite-sized work. I consider planning the next project as bite-sized work. Do not spend too much time planning the next project while the current one is in progress.

### Measure

Measuring impact is great for KPIs/OKRs and establishing whether the feature is actually achieving what you set out to do. But the main reason I like this phase is a selfish one: I love seeing the impact of my team's work; the joy in stakeholders' faces, the servers studiously crunching numbers, product usage going up, and bug counts going down. That's my primary motivation for becoming a software engineer: building products that people enjoy.
