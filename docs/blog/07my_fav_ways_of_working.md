Take home message: practical recommendation for tech company process

In my time working in startups and scaleups less than 200 people, I've found that each company has a unique way of going from ideation to production. I'd like to share with you my favourite approach.

1. All ideas get categorised into one of three buckets: 
 - Projects
   Spanning from a week to a few months, projects are scoped, planned, and prioritised by the business. They have high visibility in the company and have upfront solution designs. Teams take time to celebrate when a project is completed.
- Bite-sized work
   Usually less than a week. The overhead associated with regular prioritisation and estimation can quickly outweigh the time spent implementing it, so they are treated first-come-first-served in a Kanban style. 
 - Bugs
   I've found that the way a company handles bugs is a fantastic yard stick for its culture. If tech teams are competent and are given sufficient time to create a quality product then bugs should be minimal, making it feasible to fix all bugs quickly. But if this is not the case, bugs should be treated similar to bite-sized work. "Unimportant" bugs should be fixed, or masked from error reporting, so they do not mask real bugs or create a culture of bugs being okay.
    
2. Teams focus on one category at a time

When a team starts a project, all team members should focus solely on that project. It minimises context switching within the team; time spent on progress reports; and number of stakeholders. Unintuitively, it can feel more productive to be working and discussing multiple bodies of work, but it is an illusion of productivity.

Once a project is complete, the team shifts over to pulling in bite-sized work. I consider planning the next project as bite-sized work. Do not plan the next project while working on the current one.

2. Teams

- [bugs, projects, bite-sized]
- bugs: fix them all, they take time to read, "unimportant" bugs can grow to important ones or hide important ones, create a culture of recklessness
- bite-sized: minimal overhead (prioritisting + estimating), the overhead associated with each change can be significant compared to the time to do the work, can end up prioritising urgent work over important work, kanban style in between projects
- projects: draw relevant diagrams of how the system works right now, design how it will become and assign tickets for each change, estimate how long the whole thing will take (add 50%), start with the highest risk/complexity change, track progress by number of tickets

no standups unless someone wants one
