Some friends and I created an autonomous ground vehicle capable, and entered the Autonomous Ground Vehicle Challenge (AGVC2014). It was capable of navigating to GPS waypoints while detecting avoiding obstacles. We didn't win, but it was a great experience building something physical from the ground up, using hand-rolled sensor fusion, path planning and motor control.
