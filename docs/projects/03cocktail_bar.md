A simple Android app to store cocktail recipes.

My friends and I will occasionally have a cocktail night, where we invent new recipes. The apps on the play store were either too generic (like a note-taking app) or too complex (requiring manual linking between ingredients and recipes).

In this app, the recipes are entered as text, and auto-links to ingredients so that they can be filtered by what ingredients you in stock. Here's the [source code].
