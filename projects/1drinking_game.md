An online version of a drinking game my friends and I play, so that we could continue playing were we to be locked down during COVID.

The rules are intentionally obscure, won't make any sense to new players, and is 100% luck.

You can find the game here, [good luck!]. And here's the [source code].

I presented this project in an Adelaide AWS user group in September 2022. [Here's a copy of the presentation].
