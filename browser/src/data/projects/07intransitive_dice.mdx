There exists dice where A rolls higher than B more than 50% of the time, B rolls
higher than C more than 50% of the time, and C rolls higher than A more than 50% of the time.
These are known as [Intransitive Dice](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_dice).

For example, here are 3-sided dice with this property, which you can modify to see
the win percentages update:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [2, 6, 7],
    [1, 5, 9],
    [3, 4, 8],
  ]}
  isEditable={true}
/>

I found this really fascinating, and wanted to discover more cases.
I was interested in whether I could use them to create a game, similar
to how type advantages work in games like Pokemon (water beats fire etc.).

I approached this as an optimisation problem, trying to maximise the
differences in win percentages. If my "water" dice only has a 51% win rate
against your "fire" dice, that's not very satisfying.

For constraints, I wanted all the dice to be fair, in that no dice had a
net advantage over the others. The sum of all advantages and all disadvantages for
a particular dice should be 0%.

First, I wanted to get a feel for what intransitive dice looked like. I started with a
quick Python script that used recursion to select the next face.

To minimise ties (and to make the code easier to write), I opted to not
use the same value twice[^1]. This means that N dice with M sides would consist of the
numbers from 1 to N\*M.

Here's the best solution for 3 dice with 4 sides:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 3, 10, 12],
    [2, 7, 8, 9],
    [4, 5, 6, 11],
  ]}
  isEditable={false}

Viewing a few solutions, I noticed something interesting. The sum of each dice were equal:

- 1 + 3 + 10 + 12 = 26
- 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 26
- 4 + 5 + 6 + 11 = 26

In fact, every solution I could find had this property. Assuming it held true for all cases
(and maybe it doesn't), this meant I could discard any permutations where the sum did not add up to this
total. And importantly, I could discard them early in the search. I didn't need to populate all
N\*M faces to invalidate a permutation.

Looking at more solutions. I found that _simplicity_ was also a very important objective. Consider
these two cases of 6 dice with 4 sides:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 8, 19, 22],
    [2, 15, 16, 17],
    [3, 4, 20, 23],
    [5, 6, 18, 21],
    [7, 9, 10, 24],
    [11, 12, 13, 14],
  ]}
  isEditable={false}

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 12, 18, 19],
    [2, 3, 22, 23],
    [4, 5, 20, 21],
    [6, 7, 13, 24],
    [8, 9, 16, 17],
    [10, 11, 14, 15],
  ]}
  isEditable={false}
/>

The first case has bigger differences, but the second case is easier to understand. There are
only 3 chances: advantage (62.5% win rate), disadvantage (37.5% win rate) and neutral (50.0% win rate).

I now had a second objective, which I handled by storing the solutions as a
[Pareto front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front).

Note that the percentages in this graph is win percentage minus loss percentage.

I also had to spend a lot of time optimising my search algorithm, as processing was taking too long even for
small numbers of dice and faces. I migrated from Python to Rust, introduced multithreading, cached comparisons,
and used an O(M) comparison algorithm. This brought the processing time for 7 dice with 4 sides down from
5 minutes to 0.5 seconds. Source code is [here.](https://github.com/Nick-Sullivan/rock-paper-scissors-dice?tab=readme-ov-file)

My favourite case[^2], and the one I ultimately created custom dice with, is this one. It uses 6 sided dice,
has 1 neutral dice and 4 intransitive dice:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 2, 3, 28, 29, 30],
    [4, 5, 17, 20, 21, 26],
    [6, 7, 8, 22, 23, 27],
    [9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 25],
    [12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19],
  ]}
  isEditable={false}
/>

I also like this solution for 3 dice with 8 sides:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 2, 3, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21],
    [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 22, 23, 24],
    [8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17],
  ]}
  isEditable={false}
/>

And 3 dice with 5 sides:

<RockPaperScissorsDice
  initialValues={[
    [1, 2, 11, 12, 14],
    [3, 4, 5, 13, 15],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
  ]}

[^1]:
    If I wanted to bring duplicates back, this could be a
    post-processing step where incremental values are joined together.
    For example, a dice with [1, 2, 7] could become [1, 1, 7].

[^2]:
    To increase the advantage, multiple rounds of rolling could be performed.
    The winner is whoever wins the majority of rounds.
    Applying 3 rounds to this case adjusts the win chance pleasingly
    close to 2/3.

    <RockPaperScissorsDice
      initialValues={[
        [1, 2, 3, 28, 29, 30],
        [4, 5, 17, 20, 21, 26],
        [6, 7, 8, 22, 23, 27],
        [9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 25],
        [12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19],
      ]}

      rounds={3}
