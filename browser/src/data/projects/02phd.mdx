My Ph.D. on Task Allocation and Collaborative Localisation in Multi-Robot Systems was completed at the [University of Adelaide] in 2019.

In short, it introduced new methods in the overlap of task allocation and collaborative localisation. Task allocation is the decision making of how to allocate agents to multiple jobs, and collaborative localisation is a sensor fusion technique to allow multiple agents to improve their understanding of their location and orientation.

I developed a highly scalable path planning algorithm that ensures agents stay near one another, and applied it to autonomous vehicles with differing sensing capabilities:

I assessed the impact of sensor noise on collaborative localisation.

I introduced improvements to auction-based allocation when the agents have different capabilities.
