This is my process for hiring new software engineers, and the reasoning behind it.

**CV screen - 2 min**

This is quick, mainly looking for red flags and oddities that might need investigating. Is it riddled with spelling mistakes? Have they had four different jobs in the last year? For frontend/design roles - is it an unattractive CV? Will they need a VISA from the company?
I don't care about what languages they've used previously, but if it's different to what we need, I'll discuss it in the phone screen to ensure they have an appetite for learning a new stack.

**Phone screen - 15 min**

This is valuable for both interviewer and interviewee. It's a chance to make sure they're a real person, can hold a basic conversation, and are comfortable with the job requirements. Ask them for a five-minute spiel about their background and what they're looking for.
Ensure the candidate understands your interview process and get their availability.

The person who performs the phone screen should be the single point of contact that the candidate can reach out to for any questions or rescheduling. You don't want them feeling like a cog in the machine.

**Easy leetcode - 30 min**

I have mixed feelings about coding challenges. On one hand, it doesn't align with what software engineers actually do, and fantastic engineers won't necessarily be good at it. On the other hand, the number of candidates with impressive resumes who are incapable of the basics of writing code is depressing. These people are overrepresented in hiring and can waste a lot of time. For that reason, I opt for a simple code challenge with a focus on logic without obscure data structures. Every engineer at your company should be able to pass this without any practice.

Use a service for this, automated so they don't feel watched, give the candidate more time than you think they would need (it's stressful, after all), let them use whatever language they are comfortable with, and review the recording at 5x speed to catch cheaters.

I consider this a [hygiene check](/blogs/21hygiene); you aren't hiring for the best coder, but being able to code is a requirement.

**Code Review - 1 hour**

In this hypothetical scenario, a junior engineer has created a new feature and provided the candidate with a system design and associated merge requests. Their team is out sick and has asked the candidate to review it for them. They've given the candidate little-to-no context but will happily answer any questions they have.

My favourite part of this approach is that it gives candidates the ability to focus on the part they are best at, whether it be the infrastructure, the backend, the frontend, or how they would communicate to a junior. And I love that it can feel comfortable even if a candidate is not doing well, whereas coding challenges can get extremely tense.

It has a built-in "humility check" where candidates can show that they know their limits, saying when they would need to get more information in order to comment.

Emphasise that the candidate might not use the full hour, and that's okay. Give at least 10 minutes to answer any questions they have that they didn't get to ask in the phone screen.

The downside of this is that it requires more effort to tailor this for each candidate, so that they have at least one part in a language they are comfortable with.

**Meet the team - 30 mins**

This is basically a test for culture. You should already have a feel for this from the previous rounds, but it can be different when there's no code to focus on. Try to do this in person.
This is also a chance to "sell" the company, highlighting the good things about working here. Be truthful and not afraid to talk about the bad things as well, but the day-to-day experience is a big part of the job, and if you've genuinely tried to make the workplace a great place to work, it can be a differentiator to other offers they may have.

**Notes**

Make sure you act quickly; all these rounds should be doable in a few days. Good candidates get snapped up quickly. It's stressful looking for a job, and giving a fast turnaround is just a nice candidate experience. Their experience in hiring will reflect what they think working for you will feel like.

Respond to every candidate. If a candidate makes it to the phone screen, include a short reason for the rejection.
