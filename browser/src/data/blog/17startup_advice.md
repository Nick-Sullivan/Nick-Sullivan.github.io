startup

- scientist, experimenting
- biggest mistake is waiting too long before colliding ideation with reality
- tldr iterate, fast

scaleup

- gardener, growing
- biggest mistake is building 100 different products instead of one focussed one
- maintenance burden, testing burden, analysis burden, planning burden, monteisation burden, difficult to upgrade (expectations of your product will rise over time r.e. quality and uptime)
- tldr focus on a small, single product
