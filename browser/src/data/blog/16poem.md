<!-- scenario is if you push a button it gives you money but kills someone else -->

Today you face an ethical fable.
A big empty room, a small wooden table.
On top of the table is a button to press,
Doing so gives you riches, but causes a mess.
You see, every click comes with a cost,
and this one is that one life is lost.

I hope, no matter your choice of fate,
at least have an internal debate (deliberate, hesitate)
Think if you wish on what you would do,
But, this story is not about you.

Pushed aside by an entrepeneur,

Please _click_ will _click_ you _click_ stop _click_ pressing?

He finally stops after hearing you moan,
But now he is calling someone on his phone.

And they blindly follow, they know his net worth.

Not a moment later, two march through the door.
He's hired immigrants, they can press it much more.

Day and night, you'll work as a pair.
A dollar an hour, it seems only fair.

<!-- slow bit that describes scaling up -->

Slow down? I can't! Too much is at stake!
Maybe I could, for the right tax break.

<!-- fast pased bit with quick rhymes about all the unethical doings to make money -->

replacing
replacing with automation and deporting them

To his lawyers confide,
whistleblowers commit suicide,

class warfare
political donations
buying journalists

If you decide that its not too late, (change the worlds fate)
please keep in mind, they won't hesitate.
