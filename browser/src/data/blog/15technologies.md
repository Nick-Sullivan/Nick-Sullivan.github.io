CDK

- doesn't have the mentallity of a clean workspace at the end, too much lingering cruft


Kubernetes
- Aptakube
  is alright, gets the job done. feels like it should be part of what kubernetes offers instead of tooling

- Tilt
  i like it, but can't be used for deploying to prod

- Garden
  ignore the UI, it's confusing
  just use config.
  Similar to kubernetes, a pain to set up but once its working it works pretty well
