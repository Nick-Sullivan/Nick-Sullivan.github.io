I've spent the last year in London, which is very different to living in Adelaide, Australia.

I'm not sure whether the differences I've noticed are due to a bigger city, or due to being in the UK, but I wanted to write down the observations I didn't expect.

I'll start with the blindingly obvious - it's a big city, with tall old buildings, lots of people (5600 people per km^2), located close to many other countries.
Adelaide is a smaller city, with small buildings, lots of space (440 people per km^2), located far away from other countries.

### University brand carries more weight

While I was job hunting, one of the questions I occasionally heard was about the ranking of the University I went to. And honestly, I didn't really know. It's not something that ever crossed my mind. 

I learned that over here, it's normal to travel to a nearby country to go to the highest ranking University you're eligible for. This then gives the idea a lot of momentum: if everyone is trying to get into the top-ranked universities, then someones university becomes a good rule of thumb for assessing academic capabilities. I can see where the movie trope of *graduated top of their class at MIT when they were 13* comes from.

There are a few universities in Adelaide, and I went to the "best" one for my degree, but I never considered moving to another Australian city. Partly because the universities aren't as old as those in UK & Europe so they haven't had time to differentiate that much, and partly because there isn't the same level of cultural differences between Australian cities.

### Seasons control your emotions

I knew about the darkness in Winter - "*the sun comes up going to work, and goes down when you leave work, so I hope you have a window.*" But what I didn't predict is how impactful a lack of vitamin D is. I'll catch myself feeling sad for no reason. This is amplified by how hard it is to exercise. I prefer running outside over running in a gym, but during Winter it's either cold or wet, or both. I've learnt that there is no good time to go for a run, you just have to cover yourself and do it.

But when the sun does come out, everyone rushes outside to enjoy it. Even those with a solitary lifestyle come out regularly for social gatherings. The days are long and the festivities are longer.

Going back to Adelaide will make me much more appreciative of the consistent daylight hours and regular, predictable sunshine.

### Overlap between the rich and poor

<!-- In Adelaide, the rich 


- closer connection between rich and poor
  - good:
  - bad: leads to a view of "if you want better conditions, get more money" rather than people believing in having livable conditions

### Trash is everywhere

I don't have anything insightful here. It's everywhere and it's disgusting.

### It feels like you're part of something

The tube is quite an experience, if you stop and look.

Every morning millions of people march into stations, zip merging and separating at escalators. They find their spots on the platform by memory, "Third-carriage-from-the-front, left of the door".
Their footprints may as well be engraved. Pathways have been optimised over years of trial and error. The [emergent behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) of an entire city
held together by the invisible string of societal norms.

And every weekend my wife and I do *something*. We know we have limited time here, so we set a target to do a weekly experience in London, and a monthly experience outside of London.
We've never run out of things to do, and it feels like we're only ever scratching the surface. Every day we see a little bit more of the whole, its a city with such depth.

But, and there is a but, the *something* you are part of is not here for you. It is not your friend. It is trying to crush you. If you're clever enough, you can use it to your advantage 
to achieve what you want: a high paying career, lifestyle, social status, whatever it may be. But it *never stops*. The rent for your shoebox is due, the mold is back, your friends want to go 
to that nice restaurant. And why wouldn't you? Why else would you be here? London is a city of entertainment, not a city of comfort.

### Cultural diversity

One of my favourite parts of London is exploring the different borough's (equivalent to Australian suburbs). There's different architectures, accents, ethnicities, food, street layouts, activities.
I find it so interesting that I can walk for an hour and see so many different ways of living.

This carries over to employment as well, people are from all over the world lead to rich discussions of cultural differences, from cooking to expectations to celebrations.

You don't really get that in Adelaide, suburbs are similar and cultural diversity in hiring has to be an active goal.

### Less tall poppy syndrome, for better or worse

[Tall poppy syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome) is the term used to describe intense scrutiny of those who have notable success. 
Australia and New Zealand are known to have quite a lot of this, and I can even see it in my own values. Talking about ones own success is seen as boastful, and fair game
for criticism if it was achieved unfairly.

The main negative is that it stifles innovation, incentivising "staying with the pack". This then pushes risk takers out bigger countries where chasing dreams is more encouraged and celebrated.

And with so many people in such a small space, even bad ideas can gain traction. There's so many ads for yet-another finance app, food delivery service, or crypto bank.
It's socially acceptable to throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks, which can be valuable (you have the best spaghetti) but also very messy (your apartment is covered in spaghetti).

But, an upside to the tall poppy culture I didn't realise is that it leads to a very high bar. The "pack" mentality leads to the smallest poppies being the butt of jokes. 
It's an expectation to not make rudimentary mistakes, to think things through, and to at least achieve a sensible minimum in your job.

Examples come up a lot in discussions with my fellow Londoners-from-Australia: building managers that don't know where anything is, 
plumbers following a youtube tutorial to fix the boiler, and the innumerable cases of government nonsense. 
I'm not suggesting Australia doesn't have these issues, but not the same extent, and they are outnumbered by people who think such failures are ridiculous.
Perhaps London has had more time to grind away at peoples expectations, or that these issues are more obvious because there's more people. 
But what you experience impacts who you become, and Londoners experience poor service frequently.

To quote my friend, "the only way this country makes sense is if you assume nobody gives a shit."
